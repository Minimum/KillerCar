# KillerCar
KillerCar is a car that kills people in Half-Life 1 games.  This plugin was created in 2011 as a way to apply trigonometry outside of the classroom.  Since then parts have been tacked onto it, eventually becoming the plugin it is today.  As a result of the informal development, this plugin is in a huge need of refactoring due to its chaotic code structure.

This project has only seen use in GS Lans events.  To avoid any potential copyright issues, the related assets are not included with this.  This release is merely to make the infamous plugin public.
